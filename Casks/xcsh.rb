  caveats <<~EOS
    xcsh has been installed to #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/bin/xcsh

    Shell completions have been installed for bash, zsh, and fish.
    You may need to restart your shell or source your shell config.

    PATH CONFLICT CHECK:
    If you previously installed xcsh via install.sh or another method,
    verify which version is active:
      which xcsh && xcsh --version

    If the active binary is not in #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/bin, you may have
    a conflicting installation. Remove old binaries from:
      ~/.local/bin/xcsh
      /usr/local/bin/xcsh

    For setup instructions, see:
      https://robinmordasiewicz.github.io/f5xc-xcsh/install/homebrew/

    Quick start:
      xcsh --help
  EOS
